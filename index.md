To learn more about me, I recommend reading my [**About**](https://greyes1996.github.io/about/) which highlights my story to science, my general philosophy, and my research interests (in significantly more detail!). If you want to get a sense of what I think, take a look at my [**Blogs**](https://greyes1996.github.io/blog). 

Finally, I am a proponent of a more inclusive science community. View more on my [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) page](https://greyes1996.github.io/dei), which highlights my current and previous activism in STEM. 

# **Contact me**

I am always happy to connect with new people about *anything!* Please do not hesitate to reach out via email or Twitter. 

Additionally, if you identify as a historical minoritized individual (such as low-income, first-generation college student, queer, undocumented, and/or a racial minority), please reach out â€” especially if you need help or advice related to science. 

Please send inquries to my personal email address: [greyes0225 [at] gmail [dot] com](mailto:greyes0225@gmail.com)
