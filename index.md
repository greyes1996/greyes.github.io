Hola! I am an MS student in the Biobehavioral Department at Teachers College, Columbia University, working in Daphna Shohamy's Learning Lab. *I am currently applying to doctoral programs:* [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OrH4y00ohf-tMxeit2iNLg1f2ngMRq-P04Gsi8EXJzk/edit) is my current CV. I am broadly interested in the realm of stress, reward learning, decision-making, and memory.  

To learn more about me, I recommend reading my [About](https://greyes1996.github.io/about/) which highlights my story to science, my general philosophy, and my research interests (in significantly more detail!). If you want to get a sense of what I think, take a look at my [Blogs](https://greyes1996.github.io/blog). 

Finally, I am a proponent of a more inclusive science community. View more on my [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) page](https://greyes1996.github.io/dei), which highlights my current and previous activism in STEM.
