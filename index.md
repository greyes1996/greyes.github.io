To learn more about me, I recommend reading my [**About**](https://greyes1996.github.io/about/) page.

If you want to get a sense of what I think, take a look at my [**Blogs**](https://greyes1996.github.io/blog). 

Finally, I am a proponent of a more inclusive science community. View more on my [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) page](https://greyes1996.github.io/dei), which highlights my current and previous activism in STEM.
