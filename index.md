Hola! I am a (proud) native of Albuquerque, NM and current graduate student at Columbia University pursuing an [M.S. in Neuroscience & Education](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/biobehavioral-sciences/neuroscience-and-education/) on a [Gates Millennium Scholarship](gmsp.org). 

Previously, I graduated from [Brown University with an Sc.B. in Cognitive Neuroscience](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/) under the mentorship of [Dr. Leslie Welch](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/leslie-welch) and [Dr. Monica Linden](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/ml32). After I graduated, I took a gap year to work as a Program Coordinator with Teaching Trust, a Dallas-based non-profit that works with school leaders to support low-income students of color. Currently, I am an RA in [Daphna Shohamy's Learning Lab](https://shohamylab.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu).

This year, *I am applying to PhD programs in Neuroscience or Psychology.* You can my most current CV [here.]({{ site.url }}/assets/GabrielReyes_CV.pdf) During graduate school, I want to know more about how our brain develops over time, how environments and experiences shape that development, and the relationship between those brain structures and behavior (with a emphasis on learning and memory systems). 

To learn more about me, I recommend reading my [About](https://greyes1996.github.io/about/) which highlights my story to science, my general philosophy, and my research interests (in significantly more detail!). If you want to get a sense of what I think, take a look at my [Blogs](https://greyes1996.github.io/blog). 

Finally, I am a proponent of a more inclusive science community. View more on my [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) page](https://greyes1996.github.io/dei), which highlights my current and previous activism in STEM.
