Last year, I had the chance to interview with [Columbia's Bridge to the PhD in STEM program](https://bridgetophd.facultydiversity.columbia.edu/). This is a 2-year predoctoral award to research at a lab at Columbia's campus. I was accepted and matched to work with [Dr. Daphna Shohamy](https://shohamylab.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/people/daphna-shohamy-phd), but ultimately declined to pursue an MS at Teachers College instead (but stayed in Daphna's lab as a graduate RA!). 

At the time I was applying, I was extremely nervous; I couldn't find many resources to help with the application or the interview. As a first-generation college student from a low-income background, I was also hesistant to apply because of imposter syndrome: I just didn't think I was good enough and that would be palably reflected in my subpar application. 

Thus, I thought I would share with you the [materials](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14GioiEMB66pVJKK5jswnrGK85ufLN48w?usp=sharing) I submitted for the application. I'll update the folder with information if I receive more, but hopefully my essays and interview notes are of some help. 

If you have additional questions, please don't hesitate to connect via email or Twitter! So long as this post is up, so, too, is my offer.
