Stay tuned! 

Currently, I am broadly interested in brain development up to adulthood related to structure and function. In particular, I hope to research more about the formation, progression, and evolution of learning and memory, the role environments and experience play in the development of those processes, and generally anything that provides insights into our brains!

Momentarily, this page will highlight details on:
* My MS Thesis project porposal
* Reseearch done in Race, Class, and Gender
* My honors thesis
