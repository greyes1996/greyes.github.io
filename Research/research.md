Stay tuned! 

Currently, I am broadly interested in brain development processes related to structure and function. In particular, I hope to research more about the formation, progression, and evolution of various brain structures, the role environments and experience play in the development of those structures, and generally anything that provides insights into our brains!

Momentarily, this page will highlight details on:
### My Masters Thesis Proposal

For my graduate program at Columbia, my thesis is exploring learning and memory and the role financial stress contributes to reward learning, decision-making, and memory. Currently, I posit that the ability to learn from rewards is not intrinsically disrupted in individuals that were reared in poverty, but rather that the onset of financial stress *interferes* with learning. I intend to explore this by utilizing a scarcity framework by inducing financial stress using a series of hypothetical financial scenarios prior to engaging in a learning task. I also intend to explore the brain regions associated with learning, memory, and stress to better understand the development of these processes. 

A copy of my experimental proposal can be found momentarily, as well as a summary of a literature review done during the first year of my program.

### My Undergraduate Honors Thesis 

Working with Dr. Leslie Welch, we explored a rare phenomenon known as Aphantasia - the inabiltiy to conjure up images in the mind's eye. We conducted a remote study where participants with and without aphantasia engaged in a mental rotation task.
