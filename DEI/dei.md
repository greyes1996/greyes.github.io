This page includes a summary of ongoing and past projects related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in science. 

### FLi Sci - A Website for First-Generation/Low-Income Scientists

I created [FLi Sci](www.flisci.com) as a result of both anger and love: frustrated with the lack of mechanisms to include poor people but optimistic that STEM fields do want to support us. The goal of the website is to consolidate resources for students to acquire skills integral to laboratory settings but without access.  

### OppNet Summer Science Research Program (SSRP)

As a Career Success Intern, I worked with the Opportunity Network to design a research trainee program for pre-college students with scientific aspirations. Originally planning to do a lab placement match program (e.g., helping students seek at research assistantships in labs in NYC), the project shifted to a remote program due to COVID-19. 

You can find a copy of the original* proposal [HERE](link).

### Resources for URMs in STEM

I worked with various scientist to create a resource guide to support URMs in STEM. The document can be found HERE. 

### NSC Work

While at Brown, I was an active participant of the [New Scientist Collective](https://www.brown.edu/academics/new-scientist-program/). NSC was a program to recruit and retain students of color pursuing degrees in science by providing professional, academic and social support. I was hired to be a Racial Equitect Coordinator, where I was tasked with spearheading various initiatives in support of their mission. Below are some of my major milestones as an NSC Coordinator:

*NSC Mentoring Program*

The NSC program was primarily focused on a mentoring program where upperclassmen were matched with students to provide 1:1 mentorship during their first year. However, data (both qualitative and quantitative) indicated that our mentoring program was not successful at retaining students in the program. I hypothesized that this was the result of our matching system: we decided who the mentors were matched to. In an effort to shift power and provide more autonomy to the mentees, I re-designed the matching program by creating a tool that showcased all elgible mentors in the program and designed a system for mentees to self-select their mentors based on their own individual needs and desire. You can find a copy of my presentation [HERE](link) and some more resources [HERE](link).

*Faculty-Student Lunch Grant Program* 

*STEM Scholars Gala*

[1] Changes to the program were made after my departure from the team over the summer which is not publicly available. For more details, please contact OppNet directly (anyone on the Career Success team) for more questions about SSRP.
