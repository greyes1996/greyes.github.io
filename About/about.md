I am a (proud) native of Albuquerque, NM and current graduate student at Columbia University where I will be pursuing a M.Sc. in Neuroscience & Education on a [Gates Millennium Scholarship](gmsp.org). 

Previously, I graduated from Brown University with an Sc.B. in Cognitive Neuroscience under the mentorship of Dr. Leslie Welch and Dr. Monica Linden. After I graduated, I took a gap year to work as a Program Coordinator with Teaching Trust, a Dallas-based non-profit that works with school leaders to support low-income students of color. 

This year, I am applying to PhD programs in Neuroscience or Psychology. During graduate school, I want to know more about how our brain develops over time, how environments and experiences shape that development, and the relationship between those brain structures and behavior.
