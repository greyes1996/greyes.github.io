I am a (proud) native of Albuquerque, NM and current graduate student at Columbia University pursuing an [M.S. in Neuroscience & Education](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/biobehavioral-sciences/neuroscience-and-education/) on a [Gates Millennium Scholarship](gmsp.org). 

Previously, I graduated from [Brown University with an Sc.B. in Cognitive Neuroscience](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/) under the mentorship of [Dr. Leslie Welch](https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/leslie-welch) and [Dr. Monica Linden](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/ml32). After I graduated, I took a gap year to work as a Program Coordinator with Teaching Trust, a Dallas-based non-profit that works with school leaders to support low-income students of color. 

This year, I am applying to PhD programs in Neuroscience or Psychology. You can access and [view the PDF here.]({{ site.url }}/assets/GabrielReyes_CV.pdf) During graduate school, I want to know more about how our brain develops over time, how environments and experiences shape that development, and the relationship between those brain structures and behavior (with a emphasis on learning and memory systems).
