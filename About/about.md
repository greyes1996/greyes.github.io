### ***About Me***

I am a (proud) native of Albuquerque, NM and current graduate student at Columbia University where I will be pursuing a M.Sc. in Neuroscience & Education on a Gates Millennium Scholarship. 

Previously, I graduated from Brown University with an Sc.B. in Cognitive Neuroscience under the mentorship of Dr. Leslie Welch and Dr. Monica Linden. After I graduated, I took a gap year to work as a Program Coordinator with Teaching Trust, a Dallas-based non-profit that works with school leaders to support low-income students of color.
