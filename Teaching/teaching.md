### Data, Activated! 

During the summer of 2020, I was a Data, Activated! TA (DATA) where I directly mentored 8 students in the Opportunity Network Fellowship program. 

### Zankel Fellowship 

### The Neuroscience of Racism 

In the final semester of my undergraduate years, Monica Linden and I created a course at Brown to investigate the neural correlates of racial bias using literature from cognitive, affective, and developmpental neuroscience. 

We taught a total of 7 students with all class years represented. Materials from the course will be posted shortly. 

### Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (April 2017 - May 2018)
