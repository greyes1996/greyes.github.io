This page includes a detailed account of my prior teaching experience. 

# **Data, Activated!** 

During the summer of 2020, I was a Data, Activated! TA (DATA) where I directly mentored 8 students in the [Opportunity Network Fellowship](https://opportunitynetwork.org/fellows/) program. 

# **The Neuroscience of Racism** 

In the final semester of my undergraduate years, Monica Linden and I created a course at Brown to investigate the neural correlates of racial bias using literature from cognitive, affective, and developmpental neuroscience. 

We taught a total of 7 students with all class years represented. Materials from the course will be posted shortly.

I was an academic assistant for the following courses:
